# Project-PL12

$\lambda_{\Pi}^{+}$-calculus, with implicit arguments/holes and some useful
extensions over [LambdaPi](https://github.com/club-doki7/LambdaPi).

Currently, this calculus uses ~~The True McBride Universe~~ Type in Type
(`* : *`) which is known for  its inconsistency. We're actively considering
alternatives, such as impredicative proposition types, universe hierarchies and
universe polymorphism.
